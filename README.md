### DPA 8090: Rendering and Shading Final Project


#### For our final project, we decided to create a fantasy scene featuring some interesting procedural textures including: magma, gems, and cooled lava. Our team size was perfect to allow for each of us to focus on one material, then work together to bring the components together.  With this, our first goal was to implement a Github architecture that would allow us to synchronize our files as we worked.  After Github was set up, we each began working in Substance Designer and then imported our works into a single Unreal Engine scene.  Daniel primarily focused on the Github, Maya modeling, the hard lava floor, and lighting; Ashley focused on the crystal gem Substance Design and Unreal Engine integration; and Ben focused on Github, the moving magma Substance Design, and Unreal Engine integration.

#### As mentioned, we started with ensuring that Github would allow us to carry out our workflow and implemented a “Github pages” architecture to allow for our work to easily be displayed as a web-page.  In addition to Github, we used: Maya for modeling, Substance Design/Painter for developing textures, and Unreal Engine to build our scene.  We started with an elegant model with some simple geometries as the basis of our scene.  Separately, we each developed our own procedural textures to commit to the scene, primarily by importing from Substance Designer to Unreal Engine.  Below are some snapshots of our organization scheme and resulting imported textures.


#### Due to the complexities of our textures, the first issue that we encountered was related to difficulties importing from Substance Designer to Unreal Engine, which we solved with some additional modifications to the resulting Unreal Engine materials to enable those interesting reactions.  Below are some snapshots of how the parallax occlusion of the gems and movement of the magma were implemented in the final result.

#### After assembling our scene, Daniel focused on developing an appealing lighting  scheme and a Niagara FX system (see below) to polish our final result.  Additionally, the resulting render makes use of a piloted camera to move around and fully appreciate the effect of the textures and lightings.  A snapshot of the final result can be seen below.

#### In conclusion, we found Substance Designer to be a powerful tool that enabled us to create interesting and beautiful procedural textures.  Additionally, we learned about similar functionalities inside of the Unreal Engine environment and learned how to develop captivating and believable fantasy scenes with our methods.
